##Project 7

###AllLifeBank Customer Segmentation   
#### Course Unsupervised Learning

AllLife Bank wants to expand its credit card customer base by targeting new customers and upsell to existing customers, to do so they want to identify different segment of customers that exist in data.

**Skills and Tools**

EDA, Kmeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering

    
##Project 6

###CreditCard Users Churn Prediction  
####Model Tuning

A bank sees decline in the number of customers using their credit cards, so bank wants to know the reasons behind the same and predict if a person will attrite or not

**Skills and Tools**

up and downsampling, regularization, hyperparameter tuning

    
##Project 5

###Travel Package Purchase Prediction   
####Ensemble Techniques

The "Visit with us" travel company dataset is used to analyze the customers' information and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced package.

**Skills and Tools**

EDA, Data Preprocessing, Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers - Bagging and Random Forest, Boosting Classifier - AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV and Business Recommendations

   
#Project 4

##AllLifeBank Personal Loan Campaign Modelling   
###Supervised Learning - Classification

AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

**Skills and Tools**

Logistic regression, multicollinearity, finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, pruning
    

#Project 3

##Cars4U Project   
###Supervised Learning - Foundations

Using Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.

**Skills and Tools**

EDA, Linear regression, Linear regression assumptions, business insights and suggestions

#Project 2

##E-news Express Project
###Statistical Analysis 

This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

**Skills and Tools**

Hypothesis Testing, a/b testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference

#Project 1

##Cardio Fitness Product Analysis using Python   
###Introduction to Data Science in Python 

Cardio fitness data of about 180 people were provided using various cardio fitness products. The objective was to study and analyze which of the products is effective in terms of fitness and usage. The project involved interpretation of statistical output to generate managerial recommendations, using regression as a prediction device and most importantly evaluating and choosing of alternative statistical models.

**Skills and Tools**

Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis, Python, Missing Value Treatment, Exploratory Data Analysis ( Variable Identification)
